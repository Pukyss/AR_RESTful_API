Hello reader, are you lost and looking for a simple example of how to use restful-API?

Then you are definitely in the right place.

This is a small ( not finished ) API with two links integrated.

Just tip any single word, and there will be displayed description synonyms etc. From one GET and company names from the USA from another.

You are free to use this code if you need to.

Have fun and keep coding.

Regards,
Andrej
